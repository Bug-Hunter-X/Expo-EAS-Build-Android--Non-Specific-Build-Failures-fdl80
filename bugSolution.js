The solution involves a systematic debugging process. It's recommended to check the following, step-by-step, noting any relevant output for each step:

1. **Clean the Project:** Completely remove the Android build folder and attempt to rebuild. 

2. **Verify Android Setup:** Ensure that the Android SDK, Gradle, and all necessary tools are properly installed and configured. Check the `android` folder in your Expo project for potential configuration issues, paying close attention to `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`.

3. **Examine the Full Build Log:** The `eas build` command, even if failing, may still produce partial logs that can offer clues. Find and examine the full logs.  You will find the logs in the EAS console.  Review the logs carefully for any error messages that might have been previously missed.

4. **Check for Dependency Issues:** Investigate your project dependencies. Outdated or conflicting packages can lead to build errors. Update all your packages to their latest versions, using `expo update`.

5. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If possible, create a minimal version of your project that only includes the essential code necessary to reproduce the problem. This simplifies debugging.

6. **Restart EAS Build:** Sometimes, a simple restart of the `eas build` process can fix temporary server-side problems. 

7. **Contact Expo Support:** If all else fails, consult the Expo documentation and community forums or contact Expo support directly.
