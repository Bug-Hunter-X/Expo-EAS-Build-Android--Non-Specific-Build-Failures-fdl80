# Expo EAS Build Android: Non-Specific Build Failures

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI's `eas build` command fails to build an Android project, returning a vague error message lacking specifics.  The challenge lies in debugging such issues, requiring investigation into various potential causes.

## Problem

When attempting to build the Android version of the project using `eas build -p android`, the process fails with an unhelpful error message. The example below shows such a case, where the error message simply states "Build failed" without providing further details.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect Android Configuration:** Problems in the `android` directory of your Expo project, such as misconfigurations in `build.gradle` or `settings.gradle`. 
* **Environment Issues:** Problems with the Android SDK, Gradle version, or other dependencies.
* **Temporary Expo Server Problems:**  Rarely, temporary disruptions with the Expo build servers might cause unexpected failures.
* **Missing Dependencies:** Issues caused by missing or incorrect dependencies in the project.

## Solution

The solution involves systematic troubleshooting steps that aim to identify the root cause. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a series of checks and actions that may assist in resolving the problem.
